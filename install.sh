# Fix incorrect mouse detection with pygame in raspbian jessie environment
# Note: not sure if this is actually necessary. running gui from local machine,
# the mouse detection is accurate. when launching gui script from remote
# machine (via ssh), the mouse tracking is off. in practice, this is a non-issue
# since the ui will always be launched at startup. however without knowing this,
# it can made development frustrating....just going to comment this out for now
